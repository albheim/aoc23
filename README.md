# Solutions for Advent of Code 2023

[Janet](https://janet-lang.org) seemed like an interesting language, so why not try to learn it through this years Advent of Code.

Sub-goals include:
* learning what a peg (parser expression grammar) is, and how to use it in Janet.
* make it reasonably quick when compiled, can I have all solutions run under 1 second as I did in Rust in 2021?

## TODO
Try to make lsp and tree-sitter work with helix?
